# Updating Cert Data

## Tap to Open

When looking at your Locker, **Tap a Cert** to open the **Edit Cert** screen.

## Update Text Fields

At the moment, CertLocker does not support changing the **Type** of a Cert once create&#x64;**.**&#x20;

For Certs of the type "Other," you can update the **Name, Description**, **CEs Earned**, and **CEs Required** fields, and your changes will be autosaved. For these Certs, you can also use the Apply Training button to assign CEs earned in trainings logged in CertLocker to this Cert.

{% hint style="info" %}
For Certs with defined **Renewal Requirements**, the CEs Earned & Required fields do not appear, nor does the Apply Training button. Instead, Cert Renewal Progress details are accessed and managed by tapping on the Recertification Progress bar.
{% endhint %}
