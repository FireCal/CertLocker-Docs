# Introduction

Welcome to CertLocker (BETA)!

This app makes it easy to keep up with all your Certs, Licenses, and Qualifications. In this early version, you can add your Certs, and we'll store them for you in the cloud. Browse your Locker to keep up with your CE progress, then when your renewal date is approaching, we'll send you a reminder. Need to send Certs to your CO? Tap the share button on My Certs, and select the ones they need.&#x20;

If you need help along the way, start with this documentation. We hope this app serves you well, and we've got a bunch of ideas for how we can do more for you. We're eager to hear from you about how we can improve existing features, and what you'd like to see added. Contact us for support and feature requests at [https://firecal.app/feedback](https://firecal.app/feedback).

We know you want to focus on what you've trained for and not get bogged down with wrangling your Certs. That's why we built CertLocker.

Work. Don't Worry.
