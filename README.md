# Introduction

**Welcome to CertLocker (BETA)!**

Our app makes it easy to keep up with all the mission critical Certs, Licenses, and Qualifications for your entire organization, as well as those earned by your professional colleagues and friends.

To get started, add your Certs, and we'll store them for you in the cloud. Browse your Locker to keep up with your CE progress, then when your renewal date is approaching, we'll send you a reminder.

Create or join the organizations where you work, and invite all the members who work there to take the friction out of verifying and maintaining compliance by keeping all member certifications and licenses current.

If you're working on CEs with friends who also work in the field, follow each other in the app to provide accountability and stay on track for renewal.

If you need help along the way, start with this documentation. We hope this app serves you well, and we've got a bunch of ideas for how we can do more for you. We're eager to hear from you about how we can improve existing features, and what you'd like to see added. Contact us for support and feature requests at [https://firecal.app/feedback](https://firecal.app/feedback).

We know you want to focus on what you've trained for and not get bogged down with wrangling your Certs. That's why we built CertLocker.

Work. Don't Worry.
