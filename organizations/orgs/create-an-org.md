# Create an Org

If you're looking to create an organization in CertLocker, you'll need a subscription at the Officer Tier, or [Contact CertLocker to join at the Department Tier](mailto:sales@firecal.app). Once you have subscribed at the necessary level, navigate to the Orgs tab in the CertLocker navbar, then tap the **Floating Action Button (FAB)** located at the bottom of the screen.
