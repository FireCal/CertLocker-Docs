# Manage Members

Managing an organization's members requires the **Admin** role. When viewing an **Org Profile**, users with the **Admin** role will see a **Manage** button in the top right corner.

Tapping the **Manage** button will navigate to the **Manage Organization** page. Tap the **Members** tab to see a searchable list of **Members**.

The **List Item** for each member is swipable to access options for managing that user's relationship to the **Org**. The **Admin** button makes that user an **Adminstrator** for the current organization. The **Officer** button makes that user an **Officer** in the current organization. The **Remove** button removes the affiliations between a user and the current organization.
