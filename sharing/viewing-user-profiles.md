## User Profile Elements

User Profiles include details about the User, as well as a button in the top right to Follow or Unfollow, depending on the existing relationship to the User being viewed.

User Certs & Organization Memberships

Based on the user's Sharing Preferences, their Profile might include a link to view their Certs.

On the User Profile, Organization Memberships are browsable, with each Organization List Item being tappable to access the Organization Profile, and even Request to Join, if appropriate.
