# Settings & Profile

## Navigate to Settings

Tapping on the Settings navbar item at the bottom of the screen will bring you to the Settings Screen. From here, you can:

* Change your profile photo
* Edit your profile information
* Change your password
* Switch the app between light and dark mode

## Update Your Profile Photo

Tap **Edit Profile Photo**, and choose whether you want to select an image from your Gallery or open up your device's camera. When you choose or take the photo you want, CertLocker will replace the default image.

## Complete Your Profile

Complete the fields shown on the **Edit Profile** screen. CertLocker will autosave as you go! If there's anything you would like to exclude, don't worry about it, none of these fields are required.

We've included identity fields like **DL** and **SSN** so down the line, we can help when it comes time to renew Certs that require this information. Don't worry if you'd rather leave them out until we add those features.

**IMPORTANT**: Updating your email address in your profile only changes the email address we'll use to contact you. In this early version of CertLocker, to update your login address, [please submit a support request](https://form.asana.com/?k=9ZDd1YrRWfsneFrr01xdug\&d=1107920631423484).

## Change Your Password

To change your password, start on the **Settings** screen, then tap **Change Password.** Enter your **Login Email Address** (and remember, this may be different than the **Contact Email Address** in your profile, if you've updated that field) then click **Send Link**. You'll receive an email at your **Login Email Address** that will walk you through the next steps.
