# Stronger Together with Orgs

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/CertBot_team.png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

CertLocker is built to work for each and every Responder, and like on any incident scene, we can do a lot more as a team. By creating or joining Orgs in CertLocker, Member Certs can be readily available to view and download on-demand by Officers and Admins without a long email chain every time there's a compliance need.

As an Org, you and your teammates can view collective progress on renewal requirements and plan training to fill the common gaps on the team. When you finish, log trainings you complete together and even have CertLocker generate Training Certificates on behalf of your validated organization, so members in attendance get CE credit when renewal time arrives.

To get started, tap the Orgs navbar item at the bottom of the app and look around. For detailed help Finding or Creating your Org in CertLocker, check out the [Organizations documentation](../organizations/orgs.md).
