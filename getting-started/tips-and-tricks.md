# Tips & Tricks

## Free Tier

#### 1. Find Your Friends & Orgs

Navigate to More>Sharing & Followers>Search to find and follow your friends and colleagues in CertLocker, using search terms including their name, contact email/phone, or location.

You can also find Organizations you belong to, like your employer, the agency where you do gig work, and your volunteer district by going to Orgs>Search.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you don't find the Org you're looking for, Subscribe at the Officer tier and you can tap the + button (FAB) at the bottom to create a new Org (but only if you're authorized to do so).
{% endhint %}

#### 2. Access Detailed Renewal Progress

Some Certs have more complex requirements than others (NREMT,  am I right?). CertLocker is ready to help you manage the complexity. Tap the Cert in your locker to load the Edit Cert screen, then tap anywhere on the Renewal Progress bar to open the detailed Renewal Requirements view.
