# Tips & Tricks

## Free Tier

### 1. Find Your Friends & Orgs

Navigate to More>Sharing & Followers>Search to find and follow your friends and colleagues in CertLocker, using search terms including their name, contact email/phone, or location.

<div align="left"><figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/1.0.0-more-sharing.PNG" alt="" width="188"><figcaption></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/1.0.0-find-friends.PNG" alt="" width="188"><figcaption></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/1.0.0-find-orgs.PNG" alt="" width="188"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

You can also find Organizations you belong to, like your employer, the agency where you do gig work, and your volunteer district by going to Orgs>Search.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you don't find the Org you're looking for, Subscribe at the Officer tier and you can tap the + button (FAB) at the bottom to create a new Org (but only if you're authorized to do so).
{% endhint %}

### 2. Access Detailed Renewal Progress

Some Certs have more complex requirements than others (NREMT,  am I right?). CertLocker is ready to help you manage the complexity. Tap the Cert in your locker to load the Edit Cert screen, then tap anywhere on the Renewal Progress bar to open the detailed Renewal Requirements view.

### 3. Apply Org & Independent Training to Renewals

Be sure to keep all your training records and certificates of completion in CertLocker, so we can help you track your progress and get all those PDFs at once when it's time to renew. Check out these simple workflows for applying independent study and org trainings to your cert renewal progress:

#### **Create Independent Training Record:** From the Training screen, tap the + button (Fab), then fill in the details of your training. When you reach the Applicable Certs section, tap Add to choose which Cert(s) this training applies to.

<div align="left"><figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/1.0.0-training.PNG" alt="" width="188"><figcaption></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/1.0.0-training-create.PNG" alt="" width="188"><figcaption></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/1.0.0-applicable-certs.PNG" alt="" width="188"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

Find and select the appropriate Cert, tap Done, then if the Cert includes Components and Requirements, you can specify which this training applies to.

<div align="left"><figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/1.0.0-add.PNG" alt="" width="188"><figcaption></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/1.0.0-add-select-component.PNG" alt="" width="188"><figcaption></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/1.0.0-training-independent-study.PNG" alt="" width="188"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

Add yourself as the sole user in the Attended list. Finally, if you received a certificate for the training you attended, attach it as a PDF or Image under Independent Study, then tap Conclude & Close.

#### Apply Org Training to Cert Renewal

You can also apply Training you attended to Cert renewals for Training Records created by someone else, as long as they added you to the Attended list. To do this, navigate to Edit Cert>Renewal Requirements screen (as described in item 2 of this article). Tap the requirement where you'd like to apply training and the UI will expand to reveal an Add Training button. Tap it to search for your training.

<div><figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/1.0.0-reqs-empty.PNG" alt="" width="188"><figcaption></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/1.0.0-reqs-expand.PNG" alt="" width="188"><figcaption></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/1.0.0-reqs-select.PNG" alt="" width="188"><figcaption></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/1.0.0-reqs-updated.PNG" alt="" width="188"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

Search scans any trainings where you're on the Attended list, and will return results matching your text entry to fields like the Title, Description, Location, Trainer's Name, and more. Tap Add on any Training Records that apply to this requirement, and you can even update your search and Add multiple trainings at the same time. Tap Done, and you'll be returned to the Renewal Requirements view to find your progress updated to reflect the CE units earned from the Applied Training.
