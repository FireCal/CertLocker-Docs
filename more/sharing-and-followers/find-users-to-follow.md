## Enter Search Terms & Follow

Search terms can be broad, including details like another user's **Name**, **City**, **State**, **Email Address**, and **Phone Number**. When you've found the **User** you'd like to **Follow**, simply tap the **Follow** button, and they'll be sent a **Follow Request** for **Approval**.

## Your Following List

While your **Follow Request** is **Pending**, you'll be able to see your new **Follow** on the **Following Tab**, and you can navigate to their **Profile** to see more information, including **Organization Memberships**. Users can set their **Sharing Preferences**, so depending on their **Settings**, you may not be able to **View** and **Share** this user's **Certs**.
