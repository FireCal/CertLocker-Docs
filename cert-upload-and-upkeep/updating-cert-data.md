# Updating Cert Data

## Tap to Open

When looking at your Locker, **Tap a Cert** to open the **Edit Cert** page.

## Update Text Fields

Make your changes to the **Name**, **Type**, and **Description** text fields, and your changes will be autosaved as you go. The **CEs Earned** and **CEs Required** fields also autosave, and as they do, you'll see the **Recertification Progress** bar recalculate and update to reflect the new CEs you've earned.
