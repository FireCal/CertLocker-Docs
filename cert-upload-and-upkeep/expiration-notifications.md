# Expiration Notifications

## 30 Days and Counting

CertLocker sends you a **Reminder** via push notification 30 days before your **Certification Expiration**. If you created a Cert within 30 days of expiration, you'll receive a Reminder the next day. When you make changes to a Cert that you've already been notified about, CertLocker resets the notify flag.

We're working on configurable Reminders, so you can be sure these notifications occur on the schedule that will be most helpful for your Cert Renewal. Stay tuned!
