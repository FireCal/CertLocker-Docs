# Replacing Attachments

## Tap to Open

When looking at your Locker, **Tap a Cert** to open the **Edit Cert** page, then scroll down past the **Thumbnail**.

## Replace with PDF

To replace the digital version or image of your Cert with a PDF, tap **Replace PDF**. You'll be presented with your device's file picker, and you can navigate to your digital copy of this cert.

CertLocker will display an **Uploading** message at the bottom and a **Success** message when it is done. Then you'll be routed to the **PDF Viewer**, where the replacement PDF will be shown.

## Replace with Image

For images, you'll be asked whether you'd like to select from your device's **Gallery** or use the **Camera** to create an image of your paper Cert.

CertLocker will display an **Uploading** message at the bottom and a **Success** message when it is done. Then you'll be routed to the **PDF Viewer**, where the replacement PDF will be shown.

**NOTE**: Image attachments will be saved in the cloud and a PDF will be created for compatibility among all your Certs throughout the app.
