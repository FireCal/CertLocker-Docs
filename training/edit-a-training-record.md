# Edit a Training Record

In CertLocker, edits can be made to a Training Record until it is marked as Concluded. This constraint helps ensure Training Record data and Certificate Generation remain consistent for all users involved.&#x20;

As the Creator of an unconcluded Training Record found on your Training screen, when you tap on that record in the list, you'll be routed to the same Create Training screen, with all the same fields and sections, allowing you to modify training details, Participating Orgs, Attendance, and Certificate Generation settings before marking the Training Record as Concluded & Closed.

For details on available fields when Creating or Editing a Training Record, see [Create a Training Record](create-a-training-record.md).
