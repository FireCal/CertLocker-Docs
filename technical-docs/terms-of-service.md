# Terms of Service

**Intellectual Property**

You are prohibited from copying, modifying, or reverse-engineering the app or its components, including source code, trademarks, and intellectual property. All rights, including trademarks, copyrights, and database rights, belong to FireCal LLC.

**Notifications**

By using the CertLocker app, you consent to receiving notifications through the methods enabled in your preferences (e.g., push notifications, in-app messages, email, SMS/MMS). Messaging rates may apply for SMS/MMS notifications. Notifications are optional and not required for app usage or purchases. You can unsubscribe from notifications at any time by following specific instructions (e.g., replying STOP for SMS/MMS or clicking “Unsubscribe” in emails) or updating your preferences in the app settings. Note: Disabling certain delivery methods may result in missed critical updates or reminders related to certifications and app functionalities.

**Privacy Policy**

By using the CertLocker app, you agree to the collection, use, and storage of your data as outlined in our Privacy Policy, available at [https://docs.certlocker.app/technical-documentation/privacy-policy](https://docs.certlocker.app/technical-documentation/privacy-policy). Please review it carefully.

**User Content and Conduct**

You are responsible for all content you upload, share, or otherwise make available via the app. Content uploaded must align with the app’s purpose: tracking certifications and related information. You assume all responsibility if you grant other users or third parties access to your information, and you acknowledge that FireCal LLC is not liable for any misuse of your content by those parties. Users must not use the app to store, share, or distribute any unrelated, illicit, or illegal content (including, without limitation, content that is unlawful, obscene, defamatory, or that includes child sexual abuse material). FireCal LLC reserves the right to remove any content or restrict access to users who violate these terms and may report violations to relevant authorities if appropriate.

**Third-Party Services**

The CertLocker app may use third-party services to deliver certain features (e.g., notifications, messaging, email, and data storage). FireCal LLC is not responsible for the performance, accuracy, or reliability of these services. By using the app, you agree to the terms and conditions of any third-party services integrated into the app.

**Indemnification**

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless FireCal LLC, its affiliates, officers, and employees from and against any claims, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including legal fees) arising from your use of the app, violation of these Terms of Service, or infringement of any third-party rights. This includes any misuse of the app that results in harm or legal consequences to FireCal LLC or other users.

**Dispute Resolution**

Any disputes arising from these Terms of Service or your use of the CertLocker app shall be resolved through binding arbitration, in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitration shall take place in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and the decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding. Users waive the right to participate in any class action lawsuits related to these Terms.

**Disclaimer of Warranties**

The CertLocker app is provided “as is” and “as available,” without any warranties, express or implied. FireCal LLC does not warrant that the app will be error-free, uninterrupted, or meet your specific requirements.

**Termination of Accounts**

FireCal LLC reserves the right to suspend or terminate your account at any time, for any reason, including but not limited to violation of these Terms of Service, suspected fraudulent activity, or misuse of the app. Termination decisions are at FireCal LLC’s sole discretion and are not subject to appeal. Upon termination, all rights granted to you will cease, and you must delete the app from your device.

**Data and Device Security**

The CertLocker app stores and processes personal data you provide to deliver its services. You are responsible for keeping your device and app access secure. We strongly discourage jailbreaking or rooting your device, as it may compromise its security and the app’s functionality.

**Internet and Data Usage**

The app requires an active internet connection (Wi-Fi or mobile data). FireCal LLC is not responsible for any limitations resulting from connectivity issues or insufficient data allowance. Users are responsible for any data or roaming charges incurred while using the app, as per their agreement with their mobile provider. If you are not the bill payer, we assume you have obtained the necessary permissions.

**User Responsibilities**

You are responsible for keeping your device functional (e.g., charged and operational). FireCal LLC is not liable for any inconvenience or loss caused by device malfunctions or your inability to access the app.

**Limitation of Liability**

While we strive to keep the app accurate and up-to-date, FireCal LLC relies on third-party services and cannot guarantee uninterrupted or error-free operation. We are not liable for direct or indirect losses resulting from reliance on the app’s functionality or third-party information.

**Updates and Termination**

We may update the app periodically to ensure compatibility with new operating system versions or to enhance features. You agree to install updates when prompted to maintain app functionality. FireCal LLC may terminate app services at any time without prior notice. Upon termination, all rights granted to you will end, and you must delete the app from your device.

**Changes to These Terms**

We may update these Terms of Service periodically. You are encouraged to review this page for updates. Changes take effect upon posting the revised terms here.
