# Share Multiple Certs

## Start in Your Locker

While viewing your Locker, tap the Share Icon in the top right corner of the screen. You'll be taken to the Share Certs screen.

Tap the **Multiselect Checkboxes** beside the Certs you'd like to share, and you'll see the **Selected Counter** increase with each selection.

Tap **Share** at the bottom of the screen, and CertLocker will create a **Combined PDF** of all the Certs you selected.

The **Share Sheet** for your device's platform will appear, offering Share destinations for a link to download the **Combined PDF** of your **Cert Selections**. Choose where you'd like to Share the selected Certs, and complete the appropriate steps for your destination.
